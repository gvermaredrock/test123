Currently I have junk traffic looking for phone numbers. Now, I have to evolve as a blog where business owners are live to chat, since they get business from here. That is possible only if I have valuable traffic generated for hundreds of keywords.
1. To get actual leads from public, not just phone num enquiry - lead gen banners on top and in content, content focused on keywords, seo, speed.
2. To add travel, astro, doctor, hair fall clinic, lawyer and a lot of sections so we can add chat - category blogs, keyword analysis
3. To add IT lead gen content, so we can capitalize on them for our own revenue.
I have seen that bloggers with my amount of traffic are making 1Lac/mo by just affiliate and adsense. I will register a company this month, hire people for my SEO ??, sales for seo, workalong and wuchna ads.
Many known sites like lbb
Blog on how to manage your business (in foreign), newsletter, let people subscribe, monetize via newsletters.
Inrease traffic immediately and then tell vendors to get a mobile app for their business where they can chat with the website visitor, wuchna visitors, with jd leads etc. Give this mobile app on a subscription.

Learn from competitors:

you now have a blog system in which listings are sprinkled in between as value add. Plus, search is on it. make this live now. we are now a blogger. Bloggers live by: affiliate marketing, selling ads, selling verified ratings to vendors, backlinking to vendor websites. Bloggers focus on SEO keywords and providing value to their readers.

Had a dream of developing an entire small country into something like a Singapore.
When my growth is dependent on just myself, why can't I grow Wuchna to be a very large company? I already have decided to provide IT services and service transactions to millions of vendors, what is stopping me? Let me start growing Wuchna.
